**Description:**  
SimuStocks is an educational stock simulator that allows students and any stock-market beginner/enthusiasts to practice their trading skills or to become familiar with the stock market, without the risk of losing any real-life funds! This simulator is connected directly to real-time stock markets, including stock prices and daily changes. In this simulator, flexible and user-friendly trading are integrated into the program to allow for a real-life experience of the stock market without fears of any financial losses. SimuStocks provide a valuable learning experience in schools and professional environments that can benefit beginners towards building a stable and rewarding financial portfolio!


**How It Works:**  
Users start with a virtual set balance where they are able to buy any real-time stocks on the user homepage. Once having bought stocks, users are able to track their gains and revenues in their portfolio tab and sell any of their stocks at their own will. Following the real-time stock market prices, the audienceâ€™s goal is to create strategic investment plans while experiencing live stock-trading. 


**Our Goal:**  
Our goal with this project is to create an easily accessible simulator of the live stock-market to provide beginners with a risk-free trading platform, allowing them to gain valuable, first-hand experience along the way. We hope to bring SimuStocks to more beginners to improve their understanding of the market before they start trading with real money.
